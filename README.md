## Recent Trends in Deep Learning Based Natural Language Processing
This electronic book contains an overview of recent trends in deep learning based natural language processing (NLP). It covers the theoretical ideas and implementation details behind deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and reinforcement learning as used to solve various NLP tasks. The book also contains a summary of state of the art results for NLP tasks such as machine translation, question answering, dialogue systems, among others. 

## About the book project
The following are the main reasons for this book project:
- An open resource to help guide young researchers in the field
- A regularly updated online resource that contains important information related to NLP research, such as:
    - state of the art results
    - emerging concepts and models
    - new benchmark datasets
    - code/dataset release
    - etc.
- A collaborative platform where expert researchers can suggest changes (e.g., incorporate SOTA results) based on their recent findings and experimental results
